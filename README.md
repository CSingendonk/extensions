The scripts in this repo are near-complete components that can be used in browser client-side js environments with a little bit of tweaking.
- these are not the latest versions, nor are they bug-free.
- the scripts will only be updated when the working draft is stable and as backups during further development.
- contact the owner of the repository for the full, working, and latest versions.
